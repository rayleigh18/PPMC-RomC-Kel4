As an electrical engineering student in Bandung Institute of Technology, I feel motivated to join IEEE ITB Student Branch. My first year in ITB, I missed the chance to join this organization because of my priority in academic. Moreover, I have joined Swimming and Water Polo Student Union of  ITB.
One of my experiences working in a team is when I was the Head of Competition Division of  Ganesha Swimming Invitation in 2019. In that division, my role is to coordinate my team members. I am quite an indecisive person, thus I also need my members' opinion aside my own to complete the final idea. I am quite an indecisive person, thus I also need my members' opinion aside my own to complete the final idea. When working on the competition booklet, I approached my members in order to teach them the way to process participants' data so everything could be done efficiently.
IEEE ITB Student Branch is the perfect society to improve my organization skills. The reason for that is because IEEE is a big scale professional organization consisted of experts from the engineering field. By joining this organization, I will have the opportunity to build connections with professionals of electrical engineering industry and take part in IEEEâ€™s program. It is stated that IEEE has opened this recruitment with developing recruiters under IEEE Indonesia's Section as the purpose.
With that idea in mind, I believe that my goals can be achieved slowly through this organization and in exchange, I can show a huge contribution during my involvement. Furthermore, in finance division, I can improve and apply my skills at financial planning, data processing and analyzing big scale of data. I try to get involved in experiences similar to working in a company and I am sure that IEEE is perfect to improve myself in this matter.
I hope that joining IEEE will improve my organization skills so that I have a better experience working in a team.
